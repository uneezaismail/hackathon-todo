# **Hackathon II**

**The Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI**

The future of software development is **AI-native and spec-driven**. As AI agents like Claude Code become more powerful, the role of the engineer shifts from "syntax writer" to "system architect." We have already explored Spec-Driven Book Authoring. Now, we want you to master the **Architecture of Intelligence**.

In this hackathon, you will master the art of building applications iteratively—starting from a simple console app and evolving it into a fully-featured, cloud-native AI chatbot deployed on Kubernetes. This journey will teach you the [Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development](https://ai-native.panaversity.org/docs/Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/nine-pillars), [Claude Code](https://ai-native.panaversity.org/docs/AI-Tool-Landscape/claude-code-features-and-workflows), [Spec-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence](https://ai-native.panaversity.org/docs/SDD-RI-Fundamentals) and Cloud-Native AI technologies through hands-on implementation.

**Excel in the Hackathon and Launch Your Journey as an AI Startup Founder 🚀**  
We've recently launched **Panaversity (panaversity.org)**, an initiative focused on teaching cutting-edge AI courses. If you perform well in this hackathon, you may be invited for an interview to join the **Panaversity core team** and potentially step into the role of a **startup founder** within this growing ecosystem. You will get a chance to work with Panaversity founders Zia, Rehan, Junaid, and Wania and become the very best. You may also get a chance to teach at Panaversity, PIAIC, and GIAIC.

## **Project Details: The Evolution of Todo**

Focus and Theme: From CLI to Distributed Cloud-Native AI Systems.  
Goal: Students act as Product Architects, using AI to build progressively complex software without writing boilerplate code.

### **Project Overview**

This project simulates the real-world evolution of software. You will start with a simple script and end with a Kubernetes-managed, event-driven, AI-powered distributed system.

### **Phase Breakdown**

### **Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App**

*Basic Level Functionality*

**Objective:** Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

💡**Development Approach:** Use the [Agentic Dev Stack workflow](#the-agentic-dev-stack:-agents.md-+-spec-kitplus-+-claude-code): Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

## **Requirements**

* Implement all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)  
* Use spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus  
* Follow clean code principles and proper Python project structure

## **Technology Stack**

* UV  
* Python 3.13+  
* Claude Code  
* Spec-Kit Plus

## **Deliverables**

1. GitHub repository with:  
* Constitution file   
* specs history folder containing all specification files  
* /src folder with Python source code  
* README.md with setup instructions  
* CLAUDE.md with Claude Code instructions  
    
2. Working console application demonstrating:  
* Adding tasks with title and description  
* Listing all tasks with status indicators  
* Updating task details  
* Deleting tasks by ID  
* Marking tasks as complete/incomplete

## **Windows Users: WSL 2 Setup**

Windows users must use WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for development:

\# Install WSL 2  
wsl \--install  
   
\# Set WSL 2 as default  
wsl \--set-default-version 2  
   
\# Install Ubuntu  
wsl \--install \-d Ubuntu-22.04

# **Phase II: Todo Full-Stack Web Application**

*Basic Level Functionality*

**Objective:** Using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus transform the console app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage.

💡**Development Approach:** Use the [Agentic Dev Stack workflow](#the-agentic-dev-stack:-agents.md-+-spec-kitplus-+-claude-code): Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

## **Requirements**

* Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application  
* Create RESTful API endpoints  
* Build responsive frontend interface  
* Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database  
* Authentication – Implement user signup/signin using Better Auth

## **Technology Stack**

| Layer | Technology |
| :---- | :---- |
| Frontend | Next.js 16+ (App Router) |
| Backend | Python FastAPI |
| ORM | SQLModel |
| Database | Neon Serverless PostgreSQL |
| Spec-Driven | Claude Code \+ Spec-Kit Plus |
| Authentication | Better Auth |

## **API Endpoints**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| GET | /api/{user\_id}/tasks | List all tasks |
| POST | /api/{user\_id}/tasks | Create a new task |
| GET | /api/{user\_id}/tasks/{id} | Get task details |
| PUT | /api/{user\_id}/tasks/{id} | Update a task |
| DELETE | /api/{user\_id}tasks/{id} | Delete a task |
| PATCH | /api/{user\_id}tasks/{id}/complete | Toggle completion |

# **Securing the REST API**

*Better Auth \+ FastAPI Integration*

# **The Challenge**

Better Auth is a JavaScript/TypeScript authentication library that runs on your **Next.js frontend**. However, your **FastAPI backend** is a separate Python service that needs to verify which user is making API requests.

# **The Solution: JWT Tokens**

Better Auth can be configured to issue **JWT (JSON Web Token)** tokens when users log in. These tokens are self-contained credentials that include user information and can be verified by any service that knows the secret key.

# **How It Works**

* User logs in on Frontend → Better Auth creates a session and issues a JWT token  
* Frontend makes API call → Includes the JWT token in the Authorization: Bearer \<token\> header  
* Backend receives request → Extracts token from header, verifies signature using shared secret  
* Backend identifies user → Decodes token to get user ID, email, etc. and matches it with the user ID in the URL  
* Backend filters data → Returns only tasks belonging to that user

# **What Needs to Change**

| Component | Changes Required |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Better Auth Config** | Enable JWT plugin to issue tokens |
| **Frontend API Client** | Attach JWT token to every API request header |
| **FastAPI Backend** | Add middleware to verify JWT and extract user |
| **API Routes** | Filter all queries by the authenticated user's ID |

# **The Shared Secret**

Both frontend (Better Auth) and backend (FastAPI) must use the **same secret key** for JWT signing and verification. This is typically set via environment variable **BETTER\_AUTH\_SECRET** in both services.

# **Security Benefits**

| Benefit | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **User Isolation** | Each user only sees their own tasks |
| **Stateless Auth** | Backend doesn't need to call frontend to verify users |
| **Token Expiry** | JWTs expire automatically (e.g., after 7 days) |
| **No Shared DB Session** | Frontend and backend can verify auth independently |

# **API Behavior Change**

**After Auth:**

| All endpoints require valid JWT token |
| :---- |
| Requests without token receive 401 Unauthorized |
| Each user only sees/modifies their own tasks |
| Task ownership is enforced on every operation |

# **Bottom Line**

The REST API endpoints stay the same (**GET /api/user\_id/tasks**, **POST /api/user\_id/tasks**, etc.), but every request now must include a JWT token, and all responses are filtered to only include that user's data.

# **Monorepo Organization For Full-Stack Projects With GitHub Spec-Kit \+ Claude Code**

This guide explains how to organize your Full-Stack Projects in a monorepo to integrate **GitHub Spec-Kit** for spec-driven development with **Claude Code**. This guide explains how to organize your repository so that Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus can effectively edit both frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) code in a single context.

\# Update database  
You: @specs/database/schema.md add due\_date field to tasks  
   
\# Full feature across stack  
You: @specs/features/authentication.md implement Better Auth login

# **Summary**

| Component | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| **/.spec-kit/config.yaml** | Spec-Kit configuration |
| **/specs/\<features\>/\*\*** | What to build |
| **/CLAUDE.md** | How to navigate and use specs |
| **/frontend/CLAUDE.md** | Frontend-specific patterns |
| **/backend/CLAUDE.md** | Backend-specific patterns |

**Key Point:**   
Spec-Kit Plus provides organized, structured specs that Claude Code can reference. The CLAUDE.md files tell Claude Code how to use those specs and project-specific conventions.

# **Summary: Monorepo vs Separate Repos**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Monorepo ⭐** | Single CLAUDE.md context, easier cross-cutting changes | Larger repo |
| Separate Repos | Clear separation, independent deployments | Claude Code needs workspace setup |

**Recommendation:**   
Use monorepo for the hackathon – simpler for Claude Code to navigate and edit both frontend and backend in a single context.

# **Key Benefits of This Structure**

| Benefit | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Single Context** | Claude Code sees entire project, can make cross-cutting changes |
| **Layered CLAUDE.md** | Root file for overview, subfolder files for specific guidelines |
| **Specs Folder** | Reference specifications directly with @specs/filename.md |
| **Clear Separation** | Frontend and backend code in separate folders, easy to navigate |

# **Phase III: Todo AI Chatbot**

*Basic Level Functionality*

**Objective:** Create an AI-powered chatbot interface for managing todos through natural language using MCP (Model Context Protocol) server architecture and using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

💡**Development Approach:** Use the [Agentic Dev Stack workflow](#the-agentic-dev-stack:-agents.md-+-spec-kitplus-+-claude-code): Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

# **Requirements**

1. Implement conversational interface for all Basic Level features  
2. Use OpenAI Agents SDK for AI logic  
3. Build MCP server with Official MCP SDK that exposes task operations as tools  
4. Stateless chat endpoint that persists conversation state to database  
5. AI agents use MCP tools to manage tasks. The MCP tools will also be stateless and will store state in the database. 

# **Technology Stack**

| Component | Technology |
| :---- | :---- |
| Frontend | OpenAI ChatKit |
| Backend | Python FastAPI |
| AI Framework | OpenAI Agents SDK |
| MCP Server | Official MCP SDK |
| ORM | SQLModel |
| Database | Neon Serverless PostgreSQL |
| Authentication | Better Auth |

9. Server holds NO state (ready for next request)

# **Natural Language Commands**

The chatbot should understand and respond to:

| User Says | Agent Should |
| :---- | :---- |
| "Add a task to buy groceries" | Call add\_task with title "Buy groceries" |
| "Show me all my tasks" | Call list\_tasks with status "all" |
| "What's pending?" | Call list\_tasks with status "pending" |
| "Mark task 3 as complete" | Call complete\_task with task\_id 3 |
| "Delete the meeting task" | Call list\_tasks first, then delete\_task |
| "Change task 1 to 'Call mom tonight'" | Call update\_task with new title |
| "I need to remember to pay bills" | Call add\_task with title "Pay bills" |
| "What have I completed?" | Call list\_tasks with status "completed" |

# **Deliverables**

1. GitHub repository with:  
* /frontend – ChatKit-based UI  
* /backend – FastAPI \+ Agents SDK \+ MCP  
* /specs – Specification files for agent and MCP tools  
* Database migration scripts  
* README with setup instructions  
    
2. Working chatbot that can:  
* Manage tasks through natural language via MCP tools  
* Maintain conversation context via database (stateless server)  
* Provide helpful responses with action confirmations  
* Handle errors gracefully  
* Resume conversations after server restart

# **OpenAI ChatKit Setup & Deployment**

## **Domain Allowlist Configuration (Required for Hosted ChatKit)**

Before deploying your chatbot frontend, you must configure OpenAI's domain allowlist for security:

1. **Deploy your frontend first to get a production URL:**  
-  Vercel: \`https://your-app.vercel.app\`  
-  GitHub Pages: \`https://username.github.io/repo-name\`  
-  Custom domain: \`https://yourdomain.com\`

2. **Add your domain to OpenAI's allowlist:**  
- Navigate to: [https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/security/domain-allowlist](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/security/domain-allowlist)  
- Click "Add domain"  
- Enter your frontend URL (without trailing slash)  
- Save changes

3. **Get your ChatKit domain key:**  
- After adding the domain, OpenAI will provide a domain key  
- Pass this key to your ChatKit configuration

## **Environment Variables**

NEXT\_PUBLIC\_OPENAI\_DOMAIN\_KEY=your-domain-key-here

*Note: The hosted ChatKit option only works after adding the correct domains under Security → Domain Allowlist. Local development (\`localhost\`) typically works without this configuration.*

# **Key Architecture Benefits**

| Aspect | Benefit |
| :---- | :---- |
| **MCP Tools** | Standardized interface for AI to interact with your app |
| **Single Endpoint** | Simpler API — AI handles routing to tools |
| **Stateless Server** | Scalable, resilient, horizontally scalable |
| **Tool Composition** | Agent can chain multiple tools in one turn |

### **Key Stateless Architecture Benefits**

* **Scalability:** Any server instance can handle any request  
* **Resilience:** Server restarts don't lose conversation state  
* **Horizontal scaling:** Load balancer can route to any backend  
* **Testability:** Each request is independent and reproducible

# **Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube, Helm Charts, kubectl-ai, Kagent, Docker Desktop, and Gordon)**

*Cloud Native Todo Chatbot with Basic Level Functionality*

**Objective:** Deploy the Todo Chatbot on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube, Helm Charts.

💡**Development Approach:** Use the [Agentic Dev Stack workflow](#the-agentic-dev-stack:-agents.md-+-spec-kitplus-+-claude-code): Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

## **Requirements**

* Containerize frontend and backend applications (Use Gordon)  
* Use Docker AI Agent (Gordon) for AI-assisted Docker operations  
* Create Helm charts for deployment (Use kubectl-ai and/or kagent to generate)  
* Use kubectl-ai and kagent for AI-assisted Kubernetes operations  
* Deploy on Minikube locally

*Note: If Docker AI (Gordon) is unavailable in your region or tier, use standard Docker CLI commands or ask Claude Code to generate the `docker run` commands for you.*

## **Technology Stack**

| Component | Technology |
| :---- | :---- |
| Containerization | Docker (Docker Desktop) |
| Docker AI | Docker AI Agent (Gordon) |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes (Minikube) |
| Package Manager | Helm Charts |
| AI DevOps | kubectl-ai, and Kagent |
| Application | Phase III Todo Chatbot |

## **AIOps**

Use [Docker AI Agent (Gordon)](https://docs.docker.com/ai/gordon/) for intelligent Docker operations:

\# To know its capabilities  
docker ai "What can you do?"

Enable Gordon: Install latest Docker Desktop 4.53+, go to Settings \> Beta features, and toggle it on.

Use [kubectl-ai](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai), and [Kagent](https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent) for intelligent Kubernetes operations:

\# Using kubectl-ai  
kubectl-ai "deploy the todo frontend with 2 replicas"  
kubectl-ai "scale the backend to handle more load"  
kubectl-ai "check why the pods are failing"  
   
\# Using kagent  
kagent "analyze the cluster health"  
kagent "optimize resource allocation"

Starting with kubectl-ai will make you feel empowered from day one. Layer in Kagent for advanced use cases. Pair them with Minikube for zero-cost learning and work.

# **Phase V: Advanced Cloud Deployment**

*Advanced Level Functionality on Azure (AKS) or Google Cloud (GKE) or Azure (AKS)*

**Objective:** Implement advanced features and deploy first on Minikube locally and then to production-grade Kubernetes on Azure/Google Cloud/Oracle and Kafka within Kubernetes Cluster or with a managed service like Redpanda Cloud.

💡**Development Approach:** Use the [Agentic Dev Stack workflow](#the-agentic-dev-stack:-agents.md-+-spec-kitplus-+-claude-code): Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

## **Part A: Advanced Features**

* Implement all Advanced Level features (Recurring Tasks, Due Dates & Reminders)  
* Implement Intermediate Level features (Priorities, Tags, Search, Filter, Sort)  
* Add event-driven architecture with Kafka  
* Implement Dapr for distributed application runtime

## **Part B: Local Deployment**

* Deploy to Minikube

# **Kafka Use Cases in Phase** 

**Event-Driven Architecture for Todo Chatbot**

# **1\. Reminder/Notification System**

┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐  
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │     │                 │  
│  Todo Service   │────▶│  Kafka Topic    │────▶│  Notification   │────▶│  User Device    │  
│  (Producer)     │     │  "reminders"    │     │  Service        │     │  (Push/Email)   │  
│                 │     │                 │     │  (Consumer)     │     │                 │  
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘

When a task with a due date is created, publish a reminder event. A separate notification service consumes and sends reminders at the right time.

# **2\. Recurring Task Engine**

┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐  
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │  
│  Task Completed │────▶│  Kafka Topic    │────▶│  Recurring Task │  
│  Event          │     │  "task-events"  │     │  Service        │  
│                 │     │                 │     │  (Creates next) │  
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘

When a recurring task is marked complete, publish an event. A separate service consumes it and auto-creates the next occurrence.

# **3\. Activity/Audit Log**

┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐  
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │  
│  All Task       │────▶│  Kafka Topic    │────▶│  Audit Service  │  
│  Operations     │     │  "task-events"  │     │  (Stores log)   │  
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │  
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘

Every task operation (create, update, delete, complete) publishes to Kafka. An audit service consumes and maintains a complete history.

# **4\. Real-time Sync Across Clients**

┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐  
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │     │                 │  
│  Task Changed   │────▶│  Kafka Topic    │────▶│  WebSocket      │────▶│  All Connected  │  
│  (Any Client)   │     │  "task-updates" │     │  Service        │     │  Clients        │  
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │     │                 │  
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘

Changes from one client are broadcast to all connected clients in real-time.

# **Kafka Topics**

| Topic | Producer | Consumer | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **task-events** | Chat API (MCP Tools) | Recurring Task Service, Audit Service | All task CRUD operations |
| **reminders** | Chat API (when due date set) | Notification Service | Scheduled reminder triggers |
| **task-updates** | Chat API | WebSocket Service | Real-time client sync |

# **Event Schema Examples**

## **Task Event**

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| event\_type | string | "created", "updated", "completed", "deleted" |
| task\_id | integer | The task ID |
| task\_data | object | Full task object |
| user\_id | string | User who performed action |
| timestamp | datetime | When event occurred |

## **Reminder Event**

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| task\_id | integer | The task ID |
| title | string | Task title for notification |
| due\_at | datetime | When task is due |
| remind\_at | datetime | When to send reminder |
| user\_id | string | User to notify |

# **Why Kafka for Todo App?**

| Without Kafka | With Kafka |
| :---- | :---- |
| Reminder logic coupled with main app | Decoupled notification service |
| Recurring tasks processed synchronously | Async processing, no blocking |
| No activity history | Complete audit trail |
| Single client updates | Real-time multi-client sync |
| Tight coupling between services | Loose coupling, scalable |

# **Bottom Line**

Kafka turns the Todo app from a simple CRUD app into an **event-driven system** where services communicate through events rather than direct API calls. This is essential for the advanced features (recurring tasks, reminders) and scales better in production.

**Key Takeaway:**   
Kafka enables decoupled, scalable microservices architecture where the Chat API publishes events and specialized services (Notification, Recurring Task, Audit) consume and process them independently.

# **Kafka Service Recommendations**

# **For Cloud Deployment**

| Service | Free Tier | Pros | Cons |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Redpanda Cloud ⭐** | Free Serverless tier | Kafka-compatible, no Zookeeper, fast, easy setup | Newer ecosystem |
| Confluent Cloud | $400 credit for 30 days | Industry standard, Schema Registry, great docs | Credit expires |
| CloudKarafka | "Developer Duck" free plan | Simple, 5 topics free | Limited throughput |
| Aiven | $300 credit trial | Fully managed, multi-cloud | Trial expires |
| Self-hosted (Strimzi) | Free (just compute cost) | Full control, learning experience | More complex setup |

# **For Local Development (Minikube)**

| Option | Complexity | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Redpanda (Docker) ⭐** | Easy | Single binary, no Zookeeper, Kafka-compatible |
| Bitnami Kafka Helm | Medium | Kubernetes-native, Helm chart |
| Strimzi Operator | Medium-Hard | Production-grade K8s operator |

# **Primary Recommendation: Self-Hosted Kafka in Kubernetes**

  You can deploy Kafka directly within your K8s cluster using the Strimzi operator. Best for hackathon because:

* Free cost  
* Dapr PubSub makes Kafka-swappable \- same APIs, clients work unchanged  
* No Zookeeper \- simpler architecture  
* Fast setup \- under 5 minutes  
* REST API \+ Native protocols

# **Self-Hosted on Kubernetes (Strimzi)**

Good learning experience for students:

\# Install Strimzi operator  
kubectl create namespace kafka  
kubectl apply \-f https://strimzi.io/install/latest?namespace=kafka  
   
\# kafka-cluster.yaml  
  apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2  
  kind: Kafka  
  metadata:  
    name: taskflow-kafka  
    namespace: kafka  
  spec:

\# Create Kafka cluster  
kubectl apply \-f kafka-cluster.yaml

# **Redpanda Cloud Quick Setup**

| Step | Action |
| :---: | :---- |
| 1 | Sign up at redpanda.com/cloud |
| 2 | Create a Serverless cluster (free tier) |
| 3 | Create topics: task-events, reminders, task-updates |
| 4 | Copy bootstrap server URL and credentials |
| 5 | Use standard Kafka clients (kafka-python, aiokafka) |

# **Python Client Example**

Standard kafka-python works with Redpanda:

from kafka import KafkaProducer  
import json  
   
producer \= KafkaProducer(  
    bootstrap\_servers="YOUR-CLUSTER.cloud.redpanda.com:9092",  
    security\_protocol="SASL\_SSL",  
    sasl\_mechanism="SCRAM-SHA-256",  
    sasl\_plain\_username="YOUR-USERNAME",  
    sasl\_plain\_password="YOUR-PASSWORD",  
    value\_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')  
)  
   
\# Publish event  
producer.send("task-events", {"event\_type": "created", "task\_id": 1})

# **Summary for Hackathon**

# **Dapr Integration Guide**

# **What is Dapr?**

**Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime)** is a portable, event-driven runtime that simplifies building microservices. It runs as a **sidecar** next to your application and provides building blocks via HTTP/gRPC APIs.

# **Dapr Building Blocks for Todo App**

| Building Block | Use Case in Todo App |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Pub/Sub** | Kafka abstraction – publish/subscribe without Kafka client code |
| **State Management** | Conversation state storage (alternative to direct DB calls) |
| **Service Invocation** | Frontend → Backend communication with built-in retries |
| **Bindings** | Cron triggers for scheduled reminders |
| **Secrets Management** | Store API keys, DB credentials securely |

# **Architecture: Without Dapr vs With Dapr**

                    \- Direct connection strings

                    Loose coupling:  
                    \- App talks to Dapr via HTTP  
                    \- Dapr handles Kafka, DB, etc.  
                    \- Swap components without code changes

# **Use Case 1: Pub/Sub (Kafka Abstraction)**

Instead of using kafka-python directly, publish events via Dapr:

**Without Dapr:**  
from kafka import KafkaProducer  
producer \= KafkaProducer(bootstrap\_servers="kafka:9092", ...)  
producer.send("task-events", value=event)

**With Dapr:**  
import httpx  
   
\# Publish via Dapr sidecar (no Kafka library needed\!)  
await httpx.post(  
    "http://localhost:3500/v1.0/publish/kafka-pubsub/task-events",  
    json={"event\_type": "created", "task\_id": 1}  
)

**Dapr Component Configuration:**  
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1  
kind: Component  
metadata:  
  name: kafka-pubsub  
spec:  
  type: pubsub.kafka  
  version: v1  
  metadata:  
    \- name: brokers  
      value: "kafka:9092"  
    \- name: consumerGroup  
      value: "todo-service"

# **Use Case 2: State Management (Conversation State)**

Store conversation history without direct DB code:

**Without Dapr:**  
from sqlmodel import Session  
session.add(Message(...))  
session.commit()

**With Dapr:**  
import httpx  
   
\# Save state via Dapr  
await httpx.post(  
    "http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore",  
    json=\[{  
        "key": f"conversation-{conv\_id}",  
        "value": {"messages": messages}  
    }\]  
)  
   
\# Get state  
response \= await httpx.get(  
    f"http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore/conversation-{conv\_id}"  
)

**Dapr Component Configuration:**  
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1  
kind: Component  
metadata:  
  name: statestore  
spec:  
  type: state.postgresql  
  version: v1  
  metadata:  
    \- name: connectionString  
      value: "host=neon.db user=... password=... dbname=todo"

# **Use Case 3: Service Invocation (Frontend → Backend)**

Built-in service discovery, retries, and mTLS:

**Without Dapr:**  
// Frontend must know backend URL  
fetch("http://backend-service:8000/api/chat", {...})

**With Dapr:**  
// Frontend calls via Dapr sidecar – automatic discovery  
fetch("http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/backend-service/method/api/chat", {...})

# **Use Case 4: Dapr Jobs API (Scheduled Reminders)**

Why Jobs API over Cron Bindings?

- Cron Bindings | Poll every X minutes, check DB  
- Dapr Jobs API | Schedule exact time, callback fires 

Schedule a reminder at exact time:  
\`\`\`python  
  import httpx

  async def schedule\_reminder(task\_id: int, remind\_at: datetime, user\_id: str):  
      """Schedule reminder using Dapr Jobs API (not cron polling)."""  
      await httpx.post(  
          f"http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/jobs/reminder-task-{task\_id}",  
          json={  
              "dueTime": remind\_at.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"),  
              "data": {  
                  "task\_id": task\_id,  
                  "user\_id": user\_id,  
                  "type": "reminder"  
              }  
          }  
      )

  Handle callback when job fires:  
  @app.post("/api/jobs/trigger")  
  async def handle\_job\_trigger(request: Request):  
      """Dapr calls this endpoint at the exact scheduled time."""  
      job\_data \= await request.json()

      if job\_data\["data"\]\["type"\] \== "reminder":  
          \# Publish to notification service via Dapr PubSub  
          await publish\_event("reminders", "reminder.due", job\_data\["data"\])

      return {"status": "SUCCESS"}

Benefits:

- No polling overhead  
- Exact timing (not "within 5 minutes")  
- Scales better (no DB scans every minute)  
- Same pattern works for recurring task spawns

# **Use Case 5: Secrets Management**

Securely store and access credentials (Optionally you can use Kubernetes Secrets):

- K8s Secrets directly: Simple, already on K8s, fewer moving parts  
- Dapr Secrets API: Multi-cloud portability, unified API across providers

Dapr Secrets becomes valuable when targeting multipleplatforms (K8s \+ Azure \+ AWS).

**Dapr Component (Kubernetes Secrets):**  
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1  
kind: Component  
metadata:  
  name: kubernetes-secrets  
spec:  
  type: secretstores.kubernetes  
  version: v1

**Access in App:**  
import httpx  
   
response \= await httpx.get(  
    "http://localhost:3500/v1.0/secrets/kubernetes-secrets/openai-api-key"  
)  
api\_key \= response.json()\["openai-api-key"\]

# **Dapr Components Summary**

| Component | Type | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **kafka-pubsub** | pubsub.kafka | Event streaming (task-events, reminders) |
| **statestore** | state.postgresql | Conversation state, task cache |
| **dapr-jobs** | Jobs API | Trigger reminder checks |
| **kubernetes-secrets** | secretstores.kubernetes | API keys, DB credentials |

# **Why Use Dapr?**

| Without Dapr | With Dapr |
| :---- | :---- |
| Import Kafka, Redis, Postgres libraries | Single HTTP API for all |
| Connection strings in code | Dapr components (YAML config) |
| Manual retry logic | Built-in retries, circuit breakers |
| Service URLs hardcoded | Automatic service discovery |
| Secrets in env vars | Secure secret store integration |
| Vendor lock-in | Swap Kafka for RabbitMQ with config change |

# **Local vs Cloud Dapr Usage**

| Phase | Dapr Usage |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Local (Minikube)** | Install Dapr, use Pub/Sub for Kafka, basic state management |
| **Cloud (DigitalOcean)** | Full Dapr: Pub/Sub, State, Bindings (cron), Secrets, Service Invocation |

# **Getting Started with Dapr**

\# Install Dapr CLI  
curl \-fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh | bash  
   
\# Initialize Dapr on Kubernetes  
dapr init \-k  
   
\# Deploy components  
kubectl apply \-f dapr-components/  
   
\# Run app with Dapr sidecar  
dapr run \--app-id backend \--app-port 8000 \-- uvicorn main:app

# **Bottom Line**

Dapr abstracts infrastructure (Kafka, DB, Secrets) behind simple HTTP APIs. Your app code stays clean, and you can swap backends (e.g., Kafka → RabbitMQ) by changing YAML config, not code.

# **The Agentic Dev Stack: AGENTS.md \+ Spec-KitPlus \+ Claude Code** {#the-agentic-dev-stack:-agents.md-+-spec-kitplus-+-claude-code}

This is a powerful integration. By combining the **declarative** nature of AGENTS.md, the **structured workflow** of Panaversity Spec-KitPlus, and the **agentic execution** of Claude Code, you move from "vibe-coding" to a professional, spec-driven engineering pipeline.

This section outlines a workflow where AGENTS.md acts as the **Constitution**, Spec-KitPlus acts as the **Architect**, and Claude Code acts as the **Builder**.

## **1\. The Mental Model: Who Does What?**

| Component | Role | Responsibility |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **AGENTS.md** | **The Brain** | Cross-agent truth. Defines *how* agents should behave, what tools to use, and coding standards. |
| **Spec-KitPlus** | **The Architect** | Manages spec artifacts (.specify, .plan, .tasks). Ensures technical rigor before coding starts. |
| **Claude Code** | **The Executor** | The agentic environment. Reads the project memory and executes Spec-Kit tools via MCP. |

**Key Idea:** Claude reads AGENTS.md via a tiny CLAUDE.md shim and interacts with Spec-KitPlus. For development setup an MCP Server and upgrade specifyplus commands to be available as Prompts in MCP. SpecKitPlus MCP server ensures every line of code maps back to a validated task.

## ---

**2\. Step 1: Initialize Spec-KitPlus**

First, scaffold the spec-driven structure in your project root. This ensures the agent has the necessary templates to create structured plans.

uv specifyplus init \<project\_name\>

**This enables the core pipeline:**

* /specify \-\> Captures requirements in speckit.specify.  
* /plan \-\> Generates the technical approach in speckit.plan.  
* /tasks \-\> Breaks the plan into actionable speckit.tasks.  
* /implement \-\> Executes the code changes.

## ---

**3\. Step 2: Create a Spec-Aware AGENTS.md**

Create AGENTS.md in your root. This file teaches all AI agents (Claude, Copilot, Gemini) how to use your specific Spec-Kit workflow.

\`\`\`markdown

\# AGENTS.md  
Here is a \*\*significantly improved, clearer, more actionable, more valuable\*\* version of your \*\*AGENTS.md\*\*.  
I kept the spirit but made it \*practical\*, \*strict\*, and \*agent-compatible\*, so Claude/Gemini/Copilot can actually follow it in real workflows.

\---

\# \*\*AGENTS.md\*\*

\#\# \*\*Purpose\*\*

This project uses \*\*Spec-Driven Development (SDD)\*\* — a workflow where \*\*no agent is allowed to write code until the specification is complete and approved\*\*.  
All AI agents (Claude, Copilot, Gemini, local LLMs, etc.) must follow the \*\*Spec-Kit lifecycle\*\*:

\> \*\*Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement\*\*

This prevents “vibe coding,” ensures alignment across agents, and guarantees that every implementation step maps back to an explicit requirement.

\---

\#\# \*\*How Agents Must Work\*\*

Every agent in this project MUST obey these rules:

1\. \*\*Never generate code without a referenced Task ID.\*\*  
2\. \*\*Never modify architecture without updating \`speckit.plan\`.\*\*  
3\. \*\*Never propose features without updating \`speckit.specify\` (WHAT).\*\*  
4\. \*\*Never change approach without updating \`speckit.constitution\` (Principles).\*\*  
5\. \*\*Every code file must contain a comment linking it to the Task and Spec sections.\*\*

If an agent cannot find the required spec, it must \*\*stop and request it\*\*, not improvise.

\---

\#\# \*\*Spec-Kit Workflow (Source of Truth)\*\*

\#\#\# \*\*1. Constitution (WHY — Principles & Constraints)\*\*

File: \`speckit.constitution\`  
Defines the project’s non-negotiables: architecture values, security rules, tech stack constraints, performance expectations, and patterns allowed.

Agents must check this before proposing solutions.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*2. Specify (WHAT — Requirements, Journeys & Acceptance Criteria)\*\*

File: \`speckit.specify\`

Contains:

\* User journeys  
\* Requirements  
\* Acceptance criteria  
\* Domain rules  
\* Business constraints

Agents must not infer missing requirements — they must request clarification or propose specification updates.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*3. Plan (HOW — Architecture, Components, Interfaces)\*\*

File: \`speckit.plan\`

Includes:

\* Component breakdown  
\* APIs & schema diagrams  
\* Service boundaries  
\* System responsibilities  
\* High-level sequencing

All architectural output MUST be generated from the Specify file.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*4. Tasks (BREAKDOWN — Atomic, Testable Work Units)\*\*

File: \`speckit.tasks\`

Each Task must contain:

\* Task ID  
\* Clear description  
\* Preconditions  
\* Expected outputs  
\* Artifacts to modify  
\* Links back to Specify \+ Plan sections

Agents \*\*implement only what these tasks define\*\*.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*5. Implement (CODE — Write Only What the Tasks Authorize)\*\*

Agents now write code, but must:

\* Reference Task IDs  
\* Follow the Plan exactly  
\* Not invent new features or flows  
\* Stop and request clarification if anything is underspecified

\> The golden rule: \*\*No task \= No code.\*\*

\---

\#\# \*\*Agent Behavior in This Project\*\*

\#\#\# \*\*When generating code:\*\*

Agents must reference:

\`\`\`  
\[Task\]: T-001  
\[From\]: speckit.specify §2.1, speckit.plan §3.4  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# \*\*When proposing architecture:\*\*

Agents must reference:

\`\`\`  
Update required in speckit.plan → add component X  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# \*\*When proposing new behavior or a new feature:\*\*

Agents must reference:

\`\`\`  
Requires update in speckit.specify (WHAT)  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# \*\*When changing principles:\*\*

Agents must reference:

\`\`\`  
Modify constitution.md → Principle \#X  
\`\`\`

\---

\#\# \*\*Agent Failure Modes (What Agents MUST Avoid)\*\*

Agents are NOT allowed to:

\* Freestyle code or architecture  
\* Generate missing requirements  
\* Create tasks on their own  
\* Alter stack choices without justification  
\* Add endpoints, fields, or flows that aren’t in the spec  
\* Ignore acceptance criteria  
\* Produce “creative” implementations that violate the plan

If a conflict arises between spec files, the \*\*Constitution \> Specify \> Plan \> Tasks\*\* hierarchy applies.

\---

\#\# \*\*Developer–Agent Alignment\*\*

Humans and agents collaborate, but the \*\*spec is the single source of truth\*\*.  
Before every session, agents should re-read:

1\. \`.memory/constitution.md\`

This ensures predictable, deterministic development.  
\`\`\`

## **4\. Step 3: Wire Spec-KitPlus into Claude via MCP**

To let Claude Code actually *run* Spec-KitPlus commands, you will set up an MCP server with prompts present in .claude/commands. Each command here will become a prompt in the MCP server.

### **4.1 Install SpecKitPlus, Create an MCP Server**

1. uv init specifyplus \<project\_name\>  
2. Create your Consitution  
3. Add Anthropic's official MCP Builder Skill   
4. Using SDD Loop (Specify, Plan, Tasks, Implement) you will  set up an MCP server with prompts present in .claude/commands  
5. Use these as part of your prompt instructions in specify: \`We have specifyplus commands on @.claude/commands/\*\* Each command takes user input and updates its prompt variable before sending it to the agent. Now you will use your mcp builder skill and create an mcp server where these commands are available as prompts. Goal: Now we can run this MCP server and connect with any agent and IDE.  
6. Test the MCP server

### **4.2 Register with Claude Code**

Add the server to your Claude Code config (usually .mcp.json at your project root):

{  
  "mcpServers": {  
    "spec-kit": {  
      "command": "spec-kitplus-mcp",  
      "args": \[\],  
      "env": {}  
    }  
  }  
}

**Success:**

- After running MCP Server and connecting it with Claude Code now you can have the same commands available as MCP prompts.

**5\. Step 4: Connect Claude Code via the "Shim"**

Copy the default [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file and integrate the content within AGENTS.md . Claude Code automatically looks for CLAUDE.md. To keep a single source of truth, use a redirection pattern.

**Create CLAUDE.md in your root:**

**\`\`\`markdown**	

@AGENTS.md  
**\`\`\`**

*This "forwarding" ensures Claude Code loads your comprehensive agent instructions into its context window immediately upon startup.*

## **6\. Step 5: The Day-to-Day Workflow**

Once configured, your interaction with Claude Code looks like this:

* **Context Loading:** You start Claude Code. It reads CLAUDE.md \-\> AGENTS.md and realizes it must use Spec-Kit.  
* **Spec Generation:**  
  * *User:* "I need a project dashboard."  
  * *Claude:* Calls speckit\_specify and speckit\_plan using the MCP.  
* **Task Breakdown:**  
  * *Claude:* Calls speckit\_tasks to create a checklist in speckit.tasks.  
* **Implementation:**  
  * *User:* "Execute the first two tasks."  
  * *Claude:* Calls speckit\_implement, writes the code, and checks it against the speckit.constitution.

**7\. Constitution vs. AGENTS.md: The Difference**

It is important not to duplicate information.

* **AGENTS.md (The "How"):** Focuses on the **interaction**. "Use these tools, follow this order, use these CLI commands."  
* **speckit.constitution (The "What"):** Focuses on **standards**. "We prioritize performance over brevity, we use async/await, we require 90% test coverage."

## ---

**Summary of Integration**

3. **Initialize:** specify init creates the structure.  
4. **Instruct:** AGENTS.md defines the rules.  
5. **Bridge:** CLAUDE.md (@AGENTS.md) connects the agent.  
6. **Empower:** MCP gives the agent the tools to execute.

**Good luck, and may your specs be clear and your code be clean\! 🚀**
